# Transaction body bytes

The **transaction body bytes** are the bytes of all the fields of a [binary representation](/en/blockchain/binary-format/transaction-binary-format) of a transaction with the exception of `id`, `signature` and `proofs` fields.

Based on the transaction body bytes, the [transaction ID](/en/blockchain/transaction/transaction-id) and the [transaction signature](/en/blockchain/transaction/transaction-signature) are generated.
