# About Ride

**Ride** is a functional programming language based on [expressions](/en/ride/base-concepts/expression).

Ride is used for writing [scripts](/en/ride/script).

The language:

* has a [strong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing)Â [static typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking)
* has no loops, recursions and goto-like expressions, and therefore is not [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness)
* is [case-sensitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity)
