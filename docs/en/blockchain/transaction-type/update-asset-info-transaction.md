# Update Asset Info transaction

An **Update Asset Info transaction** — a [transaction](/en/blockchain/transaction) that changes name and description of [asset](/en/blockchain/token) issued before.

> The Update Asset Info transaction is added since node version 1.2.0, after activating of feature #15 “Ride V4, VRF, Protobuf, Failed transactions”. Versions 1.2.x are currently available on [Stagenet](/en/blockchain/blockchain-network/stage-network) only.

The asset name and/or description with respect to the same asset can be changed no more often than after 100,000 blocks from the last change or from the moment of the asset issue.

## Protobuf scheme

See [Update Asset Info transaction protobuf scheme](/en/blockchain/binary-format/transaction-protobuf-scheme/update-asset-info-transaction-protobuf-scheme) page.
