# Account data storage

An **account data storage** is a storage, associated with an [account](/en/blockchain/account.md),  of data records.

Each account has a _single_ account data storage.

The size of an account data storage is unlimited.

## An account data storage record

An **account data storage record** is a data record that has a key-value format.

The key is a unique string.

The value is the data of one of the types:

* string
* boolean
* integral
* array of bytes

## Adding records

Records are added to an account data storage using a [data transaction](/en/blockchain/transaction-type/data-transaction.md) or an invoke script transaction.

The maximum size of a single record is [32 kilobytes](https://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves/blob/79442553314012cc0e2c1defca9d85f8a84e1770/lang/shared/src/main/scala/com/wavesplatform/lang/v1/ContractLimits.scala#L11) for data transaction and [5 kilobytes](https://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves/blob/79442553314012cc0e2c1defca9d85f8a84e1770/lang/shared/src/main/scala/com/wavesplatform/lang/v1/ContractLimits.scala#L20) for invoke script transaction.

## Editing records

The value of a record can be rewritten using a data transaction or an invoke script transaction.

The key of a record cannot be rewritten.

## Deleting records

> From version 1.2.0, it is impossible to delete account data storage records. This feature becomes available after activation of the "Ride V4 and multiple attached payments for Invoke Script Transaction" (No. 16) functionality on the node.
Version 1.2.x is currently available on [stagenet](/en/blockchain/blockchain-network/stage-network.md)

Deleting records is implemented by

- [data transaction](/en/blockchain/transaction-type/data-transaction.md)
- [DeleteKey](/en/ride/structures/common-structures/delete-key.md) structure

Deleting a record is performed by key.
