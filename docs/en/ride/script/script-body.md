# Script Body

**Script body** is the source code of the [script](/en/ride/script) that follows immediately after the [directives](/en/ride/script/directives).

The body of a [dApp script](/en/ride/script/script-types/dapp-script) is a _set_ of [definitions](/en/ride/base-concepts/definition).

The body of an [account script](/en/ride/script/script-types/account-script) and an [asset script](/en/ride/script/script-types/asset-script) is an [expression](/en/ride/base-concepts/expression).

The `CONTENT_TYPE` [directive](/en/ride/script/directives) defines what the script body is â€” an expression or a set of definitions.
