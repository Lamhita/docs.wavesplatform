You can write in the console any JavaScript code.

The console has built-in functions which you can use to:

* sign and send [transactions](/en/blockchain/transaction)
* get account balance
* read data from [account data storage](/en/blockchain/account/account-data-storage)

The documentation on the console functions is available on [GitHub](https://wavesplatform.github.io/js-test-env).
