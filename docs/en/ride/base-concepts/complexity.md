# Script complexity

**Script complexity** is a dimensionless quantity that estimates computational resources needed to execute a [script](/en/ride/script.md).

The complexity of a script is estimated based on complexities of all the [operators](/en/ride/operators.md) and [functions](/en/ride/functions.md) it consists of.

The complexity of a script can be seen in the [Waves IDE](https://ide.wavesplatform.com); it is currently limited to 4000:
