# Script

A **script** is a source code in [RIDE](/en/ride/about-ride.md) language.

## Script types

There are three types of scripts:

* [dApp scripts](/en/ride/script/script-types/dapp-script.md)
* [account scripts](/en/ride/script/script-types/account-script.md)
* [asset scripts](/en/ride/script/script-types/asset-script.md)

## Script complexity

See the page [Complexity](/en/ride/base-concepts/complexity.md).
