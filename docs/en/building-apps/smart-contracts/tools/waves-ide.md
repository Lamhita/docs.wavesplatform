# Waves IDE

 **Waves IDE** is the development environment (<https://ide.wavesplatform.com>) that allows creating and testing [Ride scripts](/en/ride/script).

## Debugging

There is no way to debug a Ride script in the Waves IDE right now.

The best way to check if the script works is to write tests and run them in the [test network](/en/blockchain/blockchain-network/test-network).
