# Why Waves

Waves is an open blockchain protocol and development toolset for Web 3.0 applications and decentralized solutions.

## Tokenization

Issuing your own token on the Waves blockchain takes one minute and does not require programming skills. The token is immediately available for transfers and trading, this is perfect for crowdfunding and ICO. [More about token issue](/en/building-apps/how-to/assets/issue)

## Smart Сontracts

Ride is Waves’ functional purpose-designed smart contract language for dApp development, designed for applying scripts to assets and accounts on the Waves blockchain, as well as for creating sophisticated programmable logic for a decentralized environment. Waves has a unique approach to decentralized application development whereby the absence of gas and non-Turing complete language help to keep the system secure and predictable.

## Leased Proof of Stake

Waves bases on a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm. Each participant's chance to generate the next block is proportional to his economic stake in the network. Unlike Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake has low hardware requirements and electricity consumption, and also makes an attack on the network unprofitable for miners.

If you don’t have enough WAVES tokens to run your own node, you can lease WAVES to a different node and get a part of their block award paid a percentage of the rewards they collect. Alternatively, you can set up a node and seek leases from other WAVES holders to reach the required amount.

LPoS allows users to lease their tokens to a Waves node and get a part of the node payout as a reward. The leased funds remain under users' control and don’t leave their accounts. [More about leasing](/en/blockchain/leasing)

## Performance

The Waves-NG protocol enhances blockchain throughput up to hundreds of transactions per seconds thanks to the unique "liquid blocks", which continuously increase until the next block is created. A transaction is put in the block in ~2 seconds on average — so apps can provide a much better user experience. [More about Waves-NG](/en/blockchain/waves-protocol/waves-ng-protocol)

## Transparency

The Waves protocol is completely open, the source code is [available on Github](https://github.com/wavesplatform). Protocol updates and inprovements are discussed by the community at the [Waves Enhancement Proposals](https://forum.wavesplatform.com/c/waves-improvment-proposals) forum. [Activation of new features](/en/waves-node/features/) and [reward changes](/en/blockchain/mining/mining-reward) are accepted by voting of the nodes.

## Ecosystem for Developers

In addition to the blockchain itself and the underlying protocols, the Waves ecosystem offers a diverse collection of tools, products and components that streamline building and running dApps. The tools are developed by both the Waves team and the community.

<! - ## Sponsoring

An application developer can pay a commission to call the dApp script instead of users and thereby lower the entry threshold for them - for example, make a free trial. [More] (/ en/blockchain/waves-protocol/sponsored-fee) ->
