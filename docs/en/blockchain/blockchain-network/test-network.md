# Test Network

Testnet is a fully functional Waves blockchain with one key exception that Waves tokens on the test network can be created freely, so they have no value. Testnet helps developers test new versions of Waves, as well as test network operations using identical versions of the software before they are carried out on the mainnet.

## How to Join Waves Testnet

1. The simplest way to join Waves testnet is by running the **Docker container image** as explained [here](/en/waves-node/waves-node-in-docker).
2. The other way is by following the steps described in [How to Install Node](/en/waves-node/how-to-install-a-node/how-to-install-a-node) article.

**Note**: In general, the difference between Mainnet, Testnet and Stagenet node is the config file (.conf) used.
