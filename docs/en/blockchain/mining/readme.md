# Mining

The **mining** is the [generation](/en/blockchain/block/block-generation.md) of blocks by [mining node](/en/blockchain/node/mining-node.md).

For generating blocks, [miners](/en/blockchain/mining/miner.md) receive a [mining reward](/en/blockchain/mining/mining-reward.md), as well as [transaction fees](/en/blockchain/transaction/transaction-fee.md), according to the [Waves-NG protocol](/en/blockchain/waves-protocol/waves-ng-protocol.md) rules.
