# Script types

There are three types of [scripts](/en/ride/script.md):

* [Account script](/en/ride/script/script-types/account-script.md)
* [Asset script](/en/ride/script/script-types/asset-script.md)
* [dApp script](/en/ride/script/script-types/dapp-script.md)

The script type is defined by the `SCRIPT_TYPE` [directive](/en/ride/script/directives.md).
