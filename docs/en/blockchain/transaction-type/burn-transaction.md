# Burn transaction

A **burn transaction** is a [transaction](/en/blockchain/transaction/) that decreases the amount of the [token](/en/blockchain/token/) on the [blockchain](/en/blockchain/blockchain/).

Tokens are burned _only_ on the [account](/en/blockchain/account/) of the sender of the transaction. Burned tokens cannot be restored back to the account.

[Reissue transaction](/en/blockchain/transaction-type/reissue-transaction) increases the amount of the token on the blockchain.
