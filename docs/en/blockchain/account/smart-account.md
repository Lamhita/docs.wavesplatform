# Smart account

A **smart account** is an [account](/en/blockchain/account.md) that has an [account script](/en/ride/script/script-types/account-script.md) attached to it.

An account script is attached to the account with a [set script transaction](/en/blockchain/transaction-type/set-script-transaction.md). Only one script can be attached to the account.
