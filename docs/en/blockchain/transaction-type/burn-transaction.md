# Burn transaction

A **burn transaction** is a [transaction](/en/blockchain/transaction.md) that decreases the amount of the [token](/en/blockchain/token.md) on the [blockchain](/en/blockchain/blockchain.md).

Tokens are burned _only_ on the [account](/en/blockchain/account.md) of the sender of the transaction. Burned tokens cannot be restored back to the account.

[Reissue transaction](/en/blockchain/transaction-type/reissue-transaction.md) increases the amount of the token on the blockchain.
