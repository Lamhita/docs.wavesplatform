# Standard Library

The **Standard Library** is a set of [built-in functions](/en/ride/functions/built-in-functions) of the [script context](/en/ride/script/script-context).

Versions of the Standard Library: — 1, 2, 3, and 4.

The version of the Standard Library used in the script is set by the `STDLIB_VERSION` [directive](/en/ride/script/directives).

It is advised to use version 3 of the Standard Library when developing applications; versions 1 and 2 are required for backward compatibility.

> :warning: Standard library version 4 becomes available since node version 1.2.0, after activation of feature #15 “Ride V4, VRF, Protobuf, Failed transactions”. Versions 1.2.x are currently available on [Stagenet](/en/blockchain/blockchain-network/stage-network) only.
