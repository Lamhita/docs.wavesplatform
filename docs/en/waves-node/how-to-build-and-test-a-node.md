# Installing from Source (Building SBT)

This installation method implicates building DEB or JAR package from Waves git source code files, then running the node from your own DEB or JAR package. The method can be useful for blockchain developers, who want to customize the node files before installation as well as for the advanced node owners, who want check that the source code files of the running node are 100% safe to run.

To build and test your Waves Node, follow the steps:

## 1. Setup the Environment

### Installing Java

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install default-jre default-jdk
```

>**Note**: To increase memory of Linux-based JVM (Java Virtual Machine) in the `~/.bashrc` file add the following:
>  ```bash
>  SBT_OPTS="-XX:MaxJavaStackTraceDepth=5000 -Xmx2536M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -Xss2M"
>  ```

### Installing SBT

Please follow the SBT installation instructions depending on your operating system ([Mac](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Mac.html), [Windows](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Windows.html), [Linux](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html)).

## 2. Obtaining Source Codes

```bash
git clone git@github.com:wavesplatform/Waves.git
cd Waves
```

## 3. Running Unit Tests

```bash
sbt test
```

## 4. Building Packages

* ### Mainnet

```bash
sbt packageAll
```

* ### Testnet

```bash
sbt -Dnetwork=testnet packageAll
```

## 5. Installing DEB Package

DEB package located in target folder. You can replace '\*' with actual package name:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i target/*.deb
```

## 6. Running Fat JAR

You can replace waves-all\*.jar with actual jar name \(it should have "all"-word\):

```bash
java -jar target/waves-all*.jar path/to/config/file
```

> :bulb: For OSX - homebrew is preferable choice. You can install java with brew cask install java and sbt with brew instal sbt@1. Build/Test steps are common for any OS \(but you should use â€˜\' instead of '/' in windows\).
