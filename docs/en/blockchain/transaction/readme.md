# Transaction

A **transaction** is an action on the [blockchain](/en/blockchain.md) on behalf of the [account](/en/blockchain/account.md).

Transactions can be sent _only_ from an account â€” thus, any transaction can be associated with some account.

There are several [transaction types](/en/blockchain/transaction-type.md).

Each transaction has a [timestamp](/en/blockchain/transaction/transaction-timestamp.md) and a [unique ID](/en/blockchain/transaction/transaction-id.md).

All transactions, with the exception of the [genesis transaction](/en/blockchain/transaction-type/genesis-transaction.md), have [versions](/en/blockchain/transaction/transaction-version.md).
